Coding is fun
Coding is great 
Its an addiction that I feed daily
The things I can create is endless 
Let's see what beauty I can bring to the web
Colors and images
Beautiful UI
Enjoying my life 
Through the expression of my imagination
When you find the thing that you love
You are a truly blessed being
Nobody said it would be easy
I definietely is not
But is fun 
And I love it
I always feel happy when I am creating
But sometimes I feel sad 
That there is not enough time in a day
To do all the things I want to achieve
Where did this love for coding come from
And where has it been all my life?
They say everything happens at the right time
I am glad I have finally found something I truely love
When you commit to the thing that you love
Nobody can get in the way of the progression of a dream realised
